# TioHax-Cheat-Menu
This is a Cheat Client for Gats.io, which I have now stopped working on.

# how to build: (needs java)
1) make changes to input.js
2) run compile.bat and wait
3) if an error appears, fix it and go to step 2
4) open output.js in a text editor
5) remove newlines (or replace with spaces if at either side of a newline is a non-special character)
6) either paste it into gats.io's devtools console or put the build into a bookmarklet
