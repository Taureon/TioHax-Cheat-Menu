    DATED- 2022/9/30

    Hey guys, Taureon here.
    Also known as TheS3xHaver in game.



    If you made it here, it means you found my cheat software, TioHax Cheat Menu.
    You are probably asking a few questions, some of which I will hopefully be answering here.



    Q: Why did you make cheat software?
    A: Gats.io is really not noob-friendly at all. If you are a new player, you get destroyed by regulars, as in you do not have a chance to play at all since you die in every interaction.
    Using Vaakir Client made me have fun at the game for once, but I thought Vaakir's public client was incredibly simple,
    and at roughly the same time I saw how badly obfuscated the game was and took it like the game was challenging me to hack it.

    Q: When did you start hacking gats.io?
    A: Some days before 2022/7/23, the first things I did was deobfuscate the client by throwing a lots of 'string.replace(regex)' at it with node.js and also looking at greasyfork for what Vaakir did.

    Q: How did you think of the cheat's features?
    A: For the friends feature, I wanted to be friendly with certain people while making sure I could use my aimbot, for the static hud/health, I just didn't like the fact that it isn't instant.
    Some features (the ones that you can find greasyfork alternatives to) are inspired by greasyfork scripts.

    Q: Why 'TheS3xHaver'?
    A: I thought it was a funny name to have unlike 'God0fDeath' or 'SoulOfBrute'
    But the name 'The Sex Haver' wouldn't work so I had to take some liberties to make sure I could set it to my name.
    Also I got some funny reactions from others in game like "nice name" or "what the fuck is that name"

    Q: Is anyone else besides you using this cheat?
    A: Yes, I hand out closure compiled versions with DRM attached to people I trust. The DRM is so when my cheat gets leaked, I figure out who leaked it.

    Q: Why does this Github repo exist then?
    A: I stopped developing on this cheat (there is a lot of stuff I still wanted to add) and I didn't want it to simply rot on my hard drive.
    Also I figured I would like other hackers to improve/critique/learn from my code because I am not the only one who develops cheats in gats

    Q: How was developing it?
    A: It was fun, honestly. It was a fun challenge to work with the limitations of the gats client/server and the patterns of the enemy players!
    After reading though the source code multiple times, I became a master at how the game worked so I could do technically anything that still abides by game mechanic rules.
    Of course I had help from those before me (Nitrogem and Vaakir) so I could solve problems better!

    Q: Why did you stop developing it?
    A: I got IP banned from EU and restarting my router didn't help. I could just test on US but I don't like having a constant 300 ms ping.
    Also, getting IP banned made me realise how much of my time I am spending on developing this cheat when I had other projects that I also really wanted to work on.
    I wanted to make singleplayer games, multiplayer games, a weird animation software even, but this cheat managed to get all of my attention I had.
    So in a weird, unironic, serious way, thank you Dygn for IP banning me, it made me realise what I want to actually do!

    Q: What do you think of it now?
    A: I think I did a pretty good job, it is objectively the best cheat client since no one else was trying.
    I wanted it more to be an 'All-In-One' package, the WeChat of gats.io hacking, if you know what reference!

    Q: How was the community to you?
    A: While there were people who would of course hate me with every fiber of their beings (one guy (Black5heep) insulted me 5 seconds after I started playing on that day,
    that's a record!), I found people in the Gats.io community that I consider friends now!
    I even made friends from people that used to hate me. (I love being friendly in Video Games, it gives games such a charm that I sadly don't see anywhere besides TF2)

    Q: Why is this a bookmarklet?
    A: I don't use or have Tampermonkey, and I just really like bookmarklets compared to browser extensions.

    Q: Your opinion on the game balance?
    A: Excluding the fact that Shield and Dash exist, I really dislike the very core of the game balance.
    The fact that you live longer makes you stronger than people who just respawned, meaning this game is one-sided,
    so I am not surprised there are so many cheaters in this game, and that the game is also very fucking dead.

    Q: Your opinion on cheating?
    A: I dislike it when people cheat, as in "Download some script they found online", also I like to make fun of them for not having made it themselves.
    I can respect it if someone makes their own cheats, since that takes skill to do and they are actually hackers,
    unlike pabloGonzales2008 who figured out how to install Tampermonkey and somehow without installing 10 viruses.

    Q: Your opinion on people who despise cheating and insult cheaters on every possible occasion?
    A: I just think of them like this: https://youtu.be/s0EFgYOSKrs?t=16

    Q: How did you get to know the hacker group of gats?
    A: First, a 'Hacker Group' is not as epic as it sounds, I have been in two, and we all just goofed around.
    Now to actually answer the question: Nitrogem found my post on reddit where I deobfuscated some segment of code that I found funny, and he linked me to vaakir's server,
    where I made friends with both nitro and vaakir!

    Q: What are your opinions on the gats.io greasyfork userscripts?
    A: They suck, they really suck so fucking much. Almost all of them have no idea what they are doing and they don't even
    hook into the main game loop so they are out of sync so much, and that's important.
    Putting this cheat on Greasyfork is an insult to the cheat and to me.

    Q: Did you hack any game before gats.io?
    A: Yes! I used to reverse territorial.io, even made a very very simple mod loader for it for me and my gang that I now never talk to anymore...
    I stopped hacking that game because the dev of t.io used COMPETENT OBFUSCATION METHODS that reset our progress everytime the game got an update, so we got tired of it.
    I even helped out the dev by providing methods of beating scripting and multiboxing!
    I have left the territorial.io community because...
    Well, t.io is a Grand-Strategy Map Game, do I need to say more?
    If you didn't get it, the main discord server and discord clan servers are filled with ""right wing individuals"".

    Q: What will happen to your clan TACnet?
    A: Die, probably, unless someone wants ownership, then contact me!

    Q: What will you now be working on?
    A: Projects that I will be able to share to others without them thinking that I am the worst person to ever exist.
    You can always ask on my Twitter or on Discord!

    Q: How are we allowed to use this cheat?
    A: Read the license (which I got from: https://choosealicense.com/licenses/lgpl-3.0/)

    Q: Where is the deobfuscated gats client?
    A: https://github.com/Taureon/Gats.io-Client-Deobfuscated



    Infancy state of this cheat:
    TioHax Cheat Menu started out as a Vaakir Client mod that had the No Camera Movement mod embedded in it.
    Both mods didn't really get along with each other, which I quickly noticed when I played gats.io on a school computer back when I went to my school, weeks before I left it.
    The first thing I did was fix the bug that made the gun vibrate when the aimbot and player are aiming at the same time.
    Then I figured out how to make the tracers different colors, then I found out how to make the camera fix 100% better,
    and then I figured out how to make the zoom static so I wouldn't have to scroll out all the time.



    Highlights:

    two from a person who hated me but managed to ffa team with:
    'friendly fucking cheater, my day' (i was explaining to him that despite my cheats, i wanted to be friendly for the night)
    'AIMBOTTER USE YOUR HACKS TO DEFEND' (me and a guest were building a base and he was defending it)

    from a particularly salted dude who figured out I exist:
    'N**** N***** BAD F***** N***** N**** NOOB' (for the record: throwing slurs and insults at a cheater does not make them stop cheating, several people have tried, never worked, try convincing them instead! Almost worked on me once!)



    If you read through the code, I have added comments specifically for the code explorers. Feel free to read them and to get insight on cheat development!



    Final Message:
    Despite me being a cheater that is often hated by many regulars, it was actually a fun experience in the 2 months!
    I have made some friends in game by being friendly to them and by lots of talking at the middle of the night!
    (I love the friendly energy that can come from multiplayer games with in game chat, this is why multiplayer
    gaming peaked with TF2, GMod and lots of other source games. https://twitter.com/DUSKdev/status/1567644009245310976)
    I even made friends outside the game in a gats community discord, and I had lots of fun (and also lots of anger)
    interacting with everyone.



    This is about it.
    If you read through all that, thank you for taking your time.
    Good luck on your future endeavours!
